## 🧠 Room Summary

This room introduces the mindset behind offensive security — understanding how hackers think in order to better defend against them. It provides a basic simulated environment to practice attacking a vulnerable web application.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Commands Used

- `dirb` – A brute force tool used to discover hidden directories and pages on a website.

---

## 🧩 What I Did

- Learned that one way to exploit an application is by finding hidden or undocumented features.
- Used `dirb` to brute-force and identify a hidden URL on a fake bank website.
- Discovered a secret URL that allowed unauthorized access to a feature where you can add money to an account.
- Successfully exploited the vulnerability and added funds to the test account.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- To outsmart a hacker, you need to think like one.
- Brute-forcing with predictable names can reveal hidden entry points in applications.
- Hidden features can be real vulnerabilities if left exposed.
- Offensive security starts with curiosity and awareness of how systems can be misused.
