# Search Skills - TryHackMe Notes

## Introduction

We are surrounded by information. Do you prefer to surrender in the face of information overload and accept the first few results you get? Or do you like to acquire the necessary search skills to find and access what you are looking for? This room aims to help you with the latter.

## Learning Objectives

The goal of this room is to teach:

- Evaluate information sources  
- Use search engines efficiently  
- Explore specialized search engines  
- Read technical documentation  
- Make use of social media  
- Check news outlets

## Evaluation of Search Results

On the Internet, everyone can publish their writings. It can be in the form of blog posts, articles, or social media posts. It can be even in more subtle ways, such as by editing a public wiki page. This ability makes it possible for anyone to voice their unfounded claims. Everyone can express their opinion about best cyber security practices, future programming trends, and how to best prepare for a DevSecOps interview.

It is our job, as readers, to evaluate the information. Here are a few things to consider:

- **Source**: Identify the author or organization. Are they reputable?
- **Evidence and reasoning**: Are claims backed by credible evidence?
- **Objectivity and bias**: Is the information presented impartially?
- **Corroboration and consistency**: Can you find agreement from multiple sources?

## Search Engines

Most people use search engines, but few use them efficiently. Consider the following search engines:

- Google  
- Bing  
- DuckDuckGo  

### Common Search Operators (Google)

- `"exact phrase"` – Finds exact matches  
- `site:` – Restricts results to a specific domain (e.g., `site:tryhackme.com`)  
- `-` – Excludes a term (e.g., `pyramids -tourism`)  
- `filetype:` – Finds specific file types (e.g., `filetype:ppt cyber security`)

## Specialized Search Engines

### Shodan

Search engine for devices connected to the Internet (e.g. Apache 2.4.1 servers).

### Censys

Focuses on Internet hosts, websites, certificates. Useful for:

- Enumerating domains  
- Auditing ports/services  
- Discovering rogue assets  

### VirusTotal

Scans files/URLs with multiple antivirus engines. Also supports hash lookup.

### Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)

Checks if your email has appeared in data breaches.

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits

### CVE

The CVE program provides a standard ID for vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2024-29988). Managed by MITRE.  
See: [CVE Website](https://cve.mitre.org) and [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov)

### Exploit Database

Hosts verified and unverified exploits for security testing (with permission only).  
GitHub is also a rich source of PoCs and tools.

## Technical Documentation

### Linux Manual Pages

Use `man <command>` for official command documentation.

### Microsoft Docs

Microsoft provides technical documentation for its platforms.

### Product Docs

Always refer to official docs (e.g., Snort, Apache, PHP, Node.js) for:

- Latest updates  
- Full feature descriptions  

---

## Social Media and News

Social media is useful for:

- Tracking cybersecurity trends  
- Monitoring employee oversharing risks  
- Discovering vulnerabilities in real-time  

Follow cyber-focused channels and news outlets to stay updated.
